Abstract:

Big Data Project: "Classifying 1994 Census Income Data"


Dataset: 1994 Census Income (United States)
Output: prediction on whether the individual will make more than $50 000 in the upcoming year.

Description:
In this project the team's goal is to calculate the probability of individuals's income such that it will be higher than $50 000 in the upcoming year. 
The process will begin by obtaining the information from the dataset. In the next step we will focus on data analysis and pattern recognition. 
The following phase's idea is to train the programming model, and, finallly, based on the previous steps, provide the program with an input for actual prediction. The output of the program will be a rational number - a probability that will represent the individual's chance to surpass the mark of $50 000 as an income in the next year.
